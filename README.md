# Storelink Chrome Extension

Storelink is a Chrome extension that allows users to save and organize web links into customizable groups. This tool is designed to help users manage their bookmarks more efficiently by providing a quick and easy way to save links directly from their browser. For now, it is not publicly available in the google webstore extensions.

## Features

- Save the current tab's URL with a single click
- Organize links into user-defined groups
- View saved links within the extension popup
- Delete individual links as needed
- Clean and intuitive user interface

## How It Works

The extension adds a button to your Chrome toolbar. When clicked, it opens a popup where you can:

1. Enter a group name for your link (or use "Uncategorized" if left blank)
2. Save the current tab's URL to the specified group
3. View all your saved links, organized by group
4. Delete links you no longer need

## Technical Details

- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Utilizes Chrome's Storage API for data persistence
- Implements Chrome's Extension Manifest V3

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files
